# GlobalOptimizationAlgorithms

_Fang Yu | 11/22/2018_

This repository hosts global optimization of non-linear system using Generalized Simulated Annealing (GenSA) algorithm. It was compared with the popular Differential Evolution (DEoptim) algorithm for solving Rastrigin function and Thomsonâ€™s problem in terms of accuracy, number of successful runs and average number of function calls. The R functions and scripts are documented in the APPENDICES of this report. GenSA outperformed DEoptim in terms accuracy, efficiency and speed. GenSA is a great choice for global optimization of complicated nonlinear system with multiple minima/maxima.
